                    This is my first app created using React.JS, it displays a list of users in a responsive and interactive way.
                    I took my first steps into the library by creating this app, I learned a lot more about componenets, the way 
                    Data flows from one component to the other, and how to manipulate the state of the app and how to handle errors and 
                    bugs when developing in React, I also learned a lot about NPM and packages, how to update them without breaking the app, how to optimize the project size
                    and understood the "package.json" file really well and how important it is for deploying your project or when working in a team.
                    The online documentation for React was really helpful when working on it since I was complicating things
                    but the documentation showed me new methods in React.JS that are really useful and made my code much more cleaner, readable
                    and comprehensible by others, it also made me develop applications faster and more efficiently.

                    This is the project through which I learned developing with Node.JS and Express.JS, how to connect the front-end
                    to the back-end, how to send requests and receive responses and how to test them using POSTMAN before continuing,
                    how to use JSON efficiently,how to use distant APIs from online service providers, 
                    I also learned about a lot of very useful JavaScript modules like Knex js 
                    for databases and bcrypt for encrypting data, learned how to create a production version of my project by doing a code review and 
                    a security review before deploying in order to eliminate vulnerabilities: for example I had to move the API call function to the back-end
                    so that other users of the app won't be able to see my API Key in by inspecting the correspondant request.
                    I used Clairifai's machine learning API for the facial detection and PostgreSQL to create the database and let's not forget React for the front-end

                          <div>
                            <p class="mb-4">
                              This project is my greatest achievement so far, it's basically an advanced queue management system which was proposed by
                              the Tunisian company "WINCOM" during my end of studies intership there. <br>
                              If you have a service providing business such a bank, post office or any other type of business where your customers have to wait in a
                              queue in order to benefit from one of your service then this application is all you need to manage your queues and customer flow. <br>
                              I've given the administrator the ability to organize his services and counters in any way he likes and the ability to centralize all of his business branches data if
                              he has more than one geographical site in his business, he also has the history of every single client that signed up in a queue and which counter agent served every client
                              which is useful for handling customer complaints. <br>
                              Finally the administrator posesses a real-time statistcs dashboard that helps him monitor the queues precisely in each branch of his business, know the peak hours, the most in-demand service
                              and the abandonment rate of customers. <br><br>
                              Now we go to the customer part of the app, since this is web application the customer can now receive a virtual ticket using his smart-phone and is no longer 
                              required to be physically present to wait his turn, he can just sign up in a queue using his phone and wait his turn as he goes on with his day. <br>
                              Before you get your ticket though you can know exactly how many customers are in queue before you and how much time you will wait approximately. <br>
                              I've also developed a tickets kiosk module of course where the customer can still get a paper ticket in the traditional way. <br><br>
                              Moving on the counter agent part of the application, each agent is now more informed of what's going on in his queue, he can know exactly how many customers he has,
                              how many "absent" customers there is and an approximate time to serve all customers in the queue. <br>
                              He controls the flow by notifying the system that he's either "available" or "unavailable" and he can mark a customer as "absent" if he is called to the counter but doesn't show up. <br>
                              Finally the last part of the application is the counters display, it's that big screen you find in every queue system where each ticket number is displayed infront of the counter number that called that ticket,
                              and of course the numbers are updated in real-time whenever an agent makes a call, voice call also included. <br>
                              The administrator can also use the counters display screen to display a written message in order to inform the present customers of something. <br><br>
                              I've been as brief as possible in this description there are much more smaller details in the app, but I've covered the most important parts already. <br>
                              This project helped me greatly to master React.js and Node.js and hone my problem solving skills, it was a really great experience to develop a web application with this scale. <br>
                              This application is developed to work on digital terminals and any other device with a web browser installed. <br>
                              No code source or live version available for this project since it's a private one but you can see screenshots of it by clicking on the link. <br>
